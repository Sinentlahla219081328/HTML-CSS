# HTML-CSS
#INTRODUCTION TO HTML
It is the language that allows you to make sure your content is understandable to both people and computers.
The are three web programming languages : HTML, CSS and Javascript. HTML-HyperText Markup Language: It is used for structure and content of the web page,
CSS- Cascading Style Sheet is used for stylling and layout of a web page. It is responsible for how everything looks â€” the colors, fonts, and sizes. It is also capable of adding cool animations and interactions to spice things up.
Javascript allow us to manipulte the behaviour of HTML and CSS dynamical.javascript used for Client-Side, Event handling , Animations and Effect sand, Form handling.
The web or browser programming broken up into three parts to be resilient to changes in technology. JavaScript is the most powerful and fragile of the browser programming languages. The browser guesses what you meant, and does its best to fix the bug itself when HTML is broken because of a bug in the code.

#HTML TEXT FORMATTING
html uses tags, which are enclosed in less-than and greater-than symbols, to mark different elements. 
Tags come in two types:opening tags and closing tags.
we can have paragraph that uses emphasized text for effect.
It is a separate element that nested inside a paragraph with em and em tag
We use h1 to h6 tags to define Headlines and Subheadings where h1 element is the largest and most prominent, while h6 is the smallest and least attention-grabbing.

HTML Bold and Italics:There are four HTML elements related to this, two for bold and two for italic.
Using italic elements : em to add emphasis and i to apply visual italics .
The are two elements to emphasize or make something bold in HTML.The first one is the "strong" element,which is used to show importance,seriousness, or urgency.
This element adds meaning to the text. On the other hand, the "b" element is more generic and neutral.
It does not carry any specific meaning;it simply allows us to make something bold visually and does not imply any alternative voice or mood.

HTML lists are unordered lists, ordered lists, and definition lists. 
Using unordered list to define the entire list and specify its type,we wrap all the items in a ul element. Each item in the list is enclosed in an li element, which represents a list item.
Using ordered list to define the entire list and specify its type,we wrap all the items in a ol element.Each item in the list is enclosed in an li element, which represents a list item.
Using definition or description list elements it is used when we want to create a list that resembles a key-value pair in computer science.To create a definition list, we use specific elements.The term or key is enclosed in a dt tag, which stands for definition term. The description or value is enclosed in a dd tag, which stands for definition description. You can have multiple descriptions for each term by using multiple  tags. 
The entire list is wrapped in a dl tag, representing the definition list. Interestingly, the  tags and  tags are placed side by side without any additional wrapper around them.

HTML Quotes
To distinguish the quote from the surrounding text, we can wrap the whole thing in a blockqoute element, and use cite element to attribute the qoute. These two element serve a semantic purpose.They inform other computers, "Hey, this is what this is." Additionally, they provide a convenient way to apply custom styling.
Using inline quotes :  we can use the "q" element in HTML, which stands for quote. By using this element, the browser will automatically provide the appropriate quote marks for us.
Add lang= "fr"  or lang = "bg".

Date element -  the datetime attribute allows us to specify the date or time in a format that computers can understand. We write it like this: less-than time datetime="2025-05-08"greather -than May 8, 2025 then cloce the time tag.
Time Element  write it like this: less-than time datetime="DT2H30M"greather -than 2h 30m then cloce the time tag.

HTML Code, pre and br.
Using code element - if you want to showcase the code on a webpage , Put an opening code tag before the CSS snippet and a closing code tag afterward. 
When you want to add a html element you write code then put &lt; displayed as a less than sign. Similarly, typing "&gt;" will show a greater than sign. In between you put the element like H4 or P for example.
Using br tag to break at the end of each lines. The br element is a simple tag without an opening or closing tag. it just indicates where a line break should happen.
Using pre element: Pre and code elements are often combined to display a code block with proper indentation. To let the browser know that this is a block of code, you wrapped the entire content in a code element and to preserve the formatting and spacing,you further wrapped in a pre element.
